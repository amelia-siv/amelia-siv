Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
This project was to create an item-tracking program for a grocery store. The frequency of each item is recorded, allowing the user to search for an item, print item frequencies, represent the frequencies using a histogram, and exit the program. This code allows the grocer to keep track of inventory and optimize store layout and sales. 

What did you do particularly well?
The user interface was clear and straightforward. The program correctly handles input and output files and implements efficient data processing, allowing for timely lookups and updates.

Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
The code could be enhanced with better error handling to cover for crashes and file errors. Adding checks for file existence and format would provide more specific error messages. 

Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
Handling file input and output, especially when reading from and writing to files, was challenging due to potential errors such as missing files or incorrect file paths. Creating the histogram output in a visually appealing and readable format required careful consideration of the console output formatting. I overcame this by using loops and string manipulation to create the correct number of asterisks for each item. Platforms like Stack Overflow and the C++ subreddit provided useful advice and solutions to specific problems.

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
File I/O Operations: Understanding how to handle file input and output.
Data Structures and Algorithms: The use of maps and other data structures to efficiently store and manipulate data.
User Interface Design: Creating command-line interfaces and managing user input.
Problem-Solving and Debugging: Debugging skills developed during this project, such as identifying logic errors and handling exceptions.

How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
Variables, functions, and classes have meaningful names that convey their purpose, making the code self-documenting. The program implements basic error handling, inline comments, and different functions and methods are separate to allow for organized code.
